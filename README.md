## Welcome to my very first own library!
This project is a collection of general purpose functions written in C that can be used for personal use and in future projects. The goal of this project is to provide a set of useful and reusable functions for developers to incorporate into their own projects. Whether you need a function to perform basic string manipulation, mathematical calculations, or input/output operations, this library has you covered.
